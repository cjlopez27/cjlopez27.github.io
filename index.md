### CPSC 120

* Lab 7

    Lab 7, part 2 was one of my favorites since in my experience, it was the hardest lab to do. I had quite the trouble with it, as my code had small errors all around. This taught me to be patient and stay persistent. I also love Blackjack, so thatâ€™s an added plus.

* Lab 3
    
   Lab 3, part 1 was a favorite mainly because I liked how we were able to incorporate interactivity with the user. The sandwich making part was also pretty cool. This lab led me to like the coding process.

* Lab 8 

    Lab 8, part 1 was fun to code, and my partner during this lab was very helpful and cool. We used a lot of what we picked up in this lab, and it was cool to find my own way to only words longer than 3 characters before the instructions to do so were even given to us.
